# Food-Order
Food Order is a React application which users can log in and order their food by browsing in categories, areas and random meal.
Users can simply choose meals and add to their cart 

<br/>
Food Order fetches its data from the [TheMealDB](https://themealdb.com/) API.
<br/>

To consistently persist data across browser refreshes, Order Food stores the redux store on the browser's localStorage to ensure that there is no data lost & increase the performance on every re-render.
